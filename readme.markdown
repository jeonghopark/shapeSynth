## Rosetta 3D Sound


This project was starting in a experiment. I has wanted to make some sonification for a complex and a lot of data like LHC Data. Many sonification are based on the matching or a one-to-one correspondence. This method is simple and user can know by intuition. But it's need more space and time for large data.

I have found a spectrum generator method used open source programming code. I have used them as sonification algorithm and made a programm. 

It can convert to a spectrum sound from pixel datas of an image.

For this process, i have got the 3D Model of Rosetta. It can show vertices points and a wireframe of Rosetta. And then the 2D image convert directly to a spectrum sonogram.

The white pixel points indicate the amplitude. If the pixels are more dense, it will be brighter than the other, this will be make a big frequency sound.

The model view windows is like 3D viewing.  A user can change freely the image view by a 3D control, it make a lot of variety spectrum sound. Some image processing works also to change the sound.
